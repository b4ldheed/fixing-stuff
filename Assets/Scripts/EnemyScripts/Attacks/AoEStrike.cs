/// Summary:
/// A self-contained AoE strike. Sits on a prefab that represents one flavor of attack (lightning, spikes, fire, explosion, etc) - the prefab carries the visual, the Hitbox child collider, and this component to drive the strike's lifetime.
/// AoEAttack spawns one of these at the snapshotted position after the telegraph completes. The strike then runs its own activation sequence
/// and despawns itself - the spawner does not need to manage it further.
/// Each flavor configures its own intrinsic damage, hitbox active window, and total lifetime on the prefab. Different flavors can support different patterns:
///   - Instant: short hitbox window, short lifetime (lightning, explosion)
///   - Lingering: long hitbox window, may allow multi-hit on Hitbox (fire)
///   - Delayed: optional spawn delay before the hitbox activates (spikes)
