/// Summary:
/// Visual feedback for the Hobgoblin's melee attack. Subscribes to MeleeAttack
/// events and drives three layered effects:
///   - Claw rear-back during windup, snap-forward at strike
///   - Material swap on the hitbox to signal "live now" during the strike
///   - TrailRenderer enabled during the strike for a swing arc
///
/// All effects are independent and optional - leave any reference null to skip
/// that layer. The component cleans itself up if the attack is cancelled mid-swing.
